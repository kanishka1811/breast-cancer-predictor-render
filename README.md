# breast-cancer-predictor-render

ML being the future of healthcare, I made this predictor to identify whether cancer is Benign or 
Malignant. The user just needs to enter his medical details on a pleasing and comprehensible interface. It uses 
the KNN machine learning algorithm to achieve the best accuracy of 97.85%.

The project is being deployed on Render. Visit the following URL to see it in action: https://breastcancerpredictor.onrender.com/
